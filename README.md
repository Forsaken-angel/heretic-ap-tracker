# Heretic Archipelago Tracker

Heretic Archipelago tracker pack for [PopTracker](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/) with Autotracking.

You can download AP Doom/Heretic over at: https://github.com/Daivuk/apdoom/releases

PopTracker v0.25.0 or higher is recommended.

(Ethereal Crossbow, Gauntlets of the Necromancer, and Bag of Holding still dont autotrack yet and I've yet to figure out why.) -has now been corrected, thanks to subenji! Alongside a checksanity check that Zaakeil(Espy) caught!

Full credit of this pack should go to Ozone, their tracker for DOOM 1993 was of the most help! And Seto10987 for assisting with locating the IDs for the items/locations and double checking my screw ups!
